                    <p>Like many beignners, I was always fascinated by how websites work.<br> In 2026,I finally decided to dive
                    into the world of web development and start building things on my own.</p>
                    <p>I began, with HTML, the basic structure of the web.<br>It was exeiting to see how simple tags could create
                    haedings, paragraphs, images, and links.</p>
                    <p>This is just the beginning of my jounery, and I'am looking forward to sharing what I learn along the way!</p>
